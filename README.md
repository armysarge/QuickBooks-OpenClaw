## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
2. **QuickBooks Developer Account**
   - Sign up at [https://developer.intuit.com](https://developer.intuit.com)
3. **QuickBooks App**
   - Create an app in the Intuit Developer Portal
   - Enable QuickBooks Online API scope

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create QuickBooks Developer App

1. Go to [Intuit Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com)
2. Sign in and navigate to "My Apps"
3. Click "Create an app" and select "QuickBooks Online and Payments"
4. Fill in your app details:
   - **App name**: Choose a name for your app
   - **Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3001/callback`
5. After creating the app, note your:
   - **Client ID**
   - **Client Secret**
6. Under "Keys & credentials", make sure you're in the right environment:
   - **Sandbox**: For testing (recommended to start)
   - **Production**: For live data

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd "c:\Users\Shaun\Desktop\Quickbooks skill"
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Authentication

Create a `config.json` file from the template:

```bash
cp config.json.template config.json
```

Edit `config.json` and add your credentials:

```json
{
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE",
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE",
  "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:3001/callback",
  "access_token": "",
  "refresh_token": "",
  "realm_id": "",
  "token_expiry": 0
}
```

### Step 4: Authenticate with QuickBooks

The skill uses OAuth2 for authentication. The first time you run any QuickBooks operation, you'll need to authenticate:

1. The authentication process will:
   - Start a local web server on port 3001
   - Open your default browser
   - Redirect to QuickBooks authorization page
   - Capture the auth code and exchange it for tokens
   - Save tokens to `config.json`

2. After successful authentication, all subsequent API calls will use the saved tokens
3. Tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire

## OpenClaw Integration

### Add to OpenClaw Configuration

Add this skill to your OpenClaw configuration file (typically `~/.config/openclaw/config.json` or similar):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quickbooks": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["c:/Users/Shaun/Desktop/Quickbooks skill/run.js"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage with OpenClaw

Once installed and configured, the skill will be automatically available in OpenClaw. All QuickBooks tools will appear in your available skill set.

Restart OpenClaw after installation to load the skill.

## Usage Examples

### Authentication

First, authenticate with QuickBooks:

```
Use the qb_authenticate tool with your client_id and client_secret
```

The tool will open a browser for you to authorize the app. After authorization, tokens are saved automatically.

### Create a Customer

```
Use qb_create_customer with:
{
  "DisplayName": "John Doe",
  "PrimaryEmailAddr": {
    "Address": "john@example.com"
  },
  "PrimaryPhone": {
    "FreeFormNumber": "555-1234"
  }
}
```

### Create an Invoice

```
Use qb_create_invoice with:
{
  "CustomerRef": {
    "value": "123"
  },
  "Line": [
    {
      "Amount": 100.00,
      "DetailType": "SalesItemLineDetail",
      "SalesItemLineDetail": {
        "ItemRef": {
          "value": "1"
        },
        "Qty": 2,
        "UnitPrice": 50.00
      }
    }
  ],
  "DueDate": "2026-03-15",
  "TxnDate": "2026-02-21"
}
```

### Query Customers

```
Use qb_query_customers with:
{
  "query": "SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE DisplayName LIKE '%John%'"
}
```

### Get Profit & Loss Report

```
Use qb_get_profit_loss with:
{
  "start_date": "2026-01-01",
  "end_date": "2026-01-31"
}
```

### Send an Invoice

```
Use qb_send_invoice with:
{
  "invoice_id": "123",
  "email": "customer@example.com"
}
```

## SQL Query Syntax

QuickBooks uses a SQL-like query language. Examples:

```sql
-- Get all active customers
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE Active = true

-- Get invoices for a specific customer
SELECT * FROM Invoice WHERE CustomerRef = '123'

-- Get items with price greater than 50
SELECT * FROM Item WHERE UnitPrice > 50

-- Get recent transactions
SELECT * FROM Invoice WHERE TxnDate > '2026-01-01' ORDER BY TxnDate DESC

-- Get customers with email
SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE PrimaryEmailAddr IS NOT NULL
```

Supported entities for queries:
- Account
- Bill
- Customer
- Estimate
- Invoice
- Item
- Payment
- Purchase
- PurchaseOrder
- SalesReceipt
- Vendor
- And many more...

## Error Handling

The skill includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Authentication Errors**: Clear messages when tokens are invalid or expired
- **API Errors**: Detailed QuickBooks API error messages
- **Validation Errors**: Client-side validation of required fields
- **Rate Limiting**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff (if needed)

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit config.json** - Add it to `.gitignore`
2. **Use Sandbox for Testing** - Test with sandbox data first
3. **Rotate Credentials** - Regularly rotate your client secrets
4. **Secure Storage** - Keep config.json permissions restricted
5. **HTTPS in Production** - Use HTTPS redirect URIs for production

## Troubleshooting

### "Not authenticated" Error
- Run the authentication flow first using `qb_authenticate`
- Make sure config.json exists and has valid credentials

### Token Refresh Failures
- Your refresh token may have expired (they last 100 days)
- Re-authenticate using `qb_authenticate`

### API Permission Errors
- Make sure your app has the correct scopes enabled
- Check that you're using the right environment (sandbox vs production)

### Browser Doesn't Open
- Manually visit the authorization URL provided in the output
- Make sure port 3000 is available

### Port 3000 Already in Use
- Change the redirect_uri in both:
  - Your QuickBooks app settings
  - Your config.json file

## Development

### Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the skill
node run.js
```

### Debugging

Enable debug logging by setting:

```bash
export DEBUG=quickbooks:*
node run.js
```

## API Rate Limits

QuickBooks has API rate limits:
- **Sandbox**: 500 requests per app per minute
- **Production**: Varies by subscription level

The skill handles rate limiting gracefully with automatic retries.
